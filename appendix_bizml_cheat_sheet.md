# Appendix — BizML Cheat Sheet (Textstone Adaptation)

**Six steps (remember: plan backward from launch):**
1. **Value (Deployment Goal):** how the system will improve operations (decision, speed, scale).  
2. **Target (Prediction/Production Goal):** the per‑case output the system must deliver.  
3. **Performance (Metrics):** what "good" looks like and the thresholds you'll enforce.  
4. **Data (Fuel):** sources, access, quality, privacy/consent, and shaping.  
5. **Model/Pattern (Algorithm):** rules, ML, or GenAI pattern; config and evaluation.  
6. **Launch (Deployment):** integrate into the workflow; monitor; refresh.

**Execution principles:**
- Deep collaboration between business and data teams.  
- Business stakeholders develop **semi‑technical fluency** (just enough to co‑own decisions).  
- Steps aren't strictly linear—**iterate and backtrack** as you learn.  
- After launch, you're in **operations mode**: monitor, maintain, and retrain/refresh.
