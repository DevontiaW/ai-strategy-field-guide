# AI Strategy Study Guide

**Textstone Labs — AI Strategy Field Guide: from business problem → deployment → adoption**

## Why This Exists

AI strategy is hard. Most guides are either too theoretical (academic papers) or too vendor-specific (marketing materials). Product and operations leaders need practical, actionable guidance that focuses on patterns, not products. This guide bridges that gap by providing proven frameworks, ready-to-use templates, and real-world examples that help teams go from identifying AI opportunities to successful deployment and adoption. Whether you're building your first AI project or scaling your tenth, these resources eliminate guesswork and accelerate your path to measurable business value.

**Who it's for:** product/ops leaders and ICs shipping real outcomes (not demos).  
**What's inside:** use‑case selection, lifecycle & governance, GenAI patterns, eval harnesses, change management, and checklists/templates.

## Example Walkthrough

Here's how it all comes together for a typical AI project:

**1. Value Goal** → Customer service agents spend 15+ minutes reading email threads before responding  
**2. Use Case Scoring** → High impact (24% time savings), medium effort (summarization pattern), high data readiness  
**3. Lifecycle Gates** → Problem brief approved, data governance cleared, technical design validated  
**4. Prompt Card** → Structured output schema for decisions/actions/deadlines, with safety controls  
**5. Evaluation Harness** → Golden set of 150 tickets, faithfulness ≥0.95, adversarial test pass ≥0.9  
**6. Rollout** → Pilot with 10 agents, feedback collection, gradual expansion to full team  

This end-to-end flow demonstrates how each section builds on the previous one, creating a systematic approach to AI implementation.
