# AI Strategy Case Studies

## Why it matters
- **Real-world examples** demonstrate practical application of AI strategy principles.
- **Pattern recognition** helps teams identify similar opportunities in their own organizations.
- **Lessons learned** prevent common pitfalls and accelerate implementation.
- **Success stories** build confidence and stakeholder buy-in for AI initiatives.

## Core concepts
- **Pattern-first approach**: Focus on the AI pattern and business outcome, not specific vendors.
- **Public case studies**: Use only publicly available information to avoid proprietary content.
- **Metrics-driven**: Quantify impact with specific business metrics and ROI.
- **Implementation insights**: Share practical lessons about what worked and what didn't.

## Case Study Template

### [Use Case Name] ([Company/Industry])
- **Pattern**: [AI pattern used - e.g., Classification, RAG, Summarization]
- **Problem**: [Business problem being solved]
- **Solution**: [AI approach and implementation]
- **Outcome**: [Quantified results and business impact]
- **Lesson**: [Key insight or takeaway]

## Case Studies

### Support Ticket Summaries (Internal)
- **Pattern**: Summarization → JSON
- **Problem**: Customer service agents spending 15+ minutes reading long email threads before responding
- **Solution**: LLM-based summarization that extracts key decisions, risks, and action items into structured format
- **Outcome**: Handle time ↓ 24%; agent CSAT ↑ 0.3; faster resolution of complex cases
- **Lesson**: Tight output schema > clever prompt; golden set matters most for quality

### Document Classification & Routing (Financial Services)
- **Pattern**: Classification + Routing
- **Problem**: Manual document sorting causing 2-3 day delays in loan processing
- **Solution**: ML model to classify document types and route to appropriate teams
- **Outcome**: Processing time ↓ 60%; accuracy 94%; cost per document ↓ $2.50
- **Lesson**: Start with high-volume, low-risk document types; human review for edge cases

### Customer Intent Prediction (E-commerce)
- **Pattern**: Classification + Recommendation
- **Problem**: Generic product recommendations leading to low conversion rates
- **Solution**: ML model to predict customer intent and personalize product suggestions
- **Outcome**: Conversion rate ↑ 18%; average order value ↑ 12%; customer lifetime value ↑ 15%
- **Lesson**: Intent prediction more valuable than purchase history alone; A/B test everything

### Knowledge Base Q&A (Technology)
- **Pattern**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Problem**: Employees spending hours searching through documentation and getting outdated information
- **Solution**: Vector search + LLM to provide accurate, contextual answers from current docs
- **Outcome**: Time to find information ↓ 75%; support ticket volume ↓ 30%; employee satisfaction ↑ 0.4
- **Lesson**: Good retrieval beats good generation; keep knowledge base current

### Fraud Detection (Fintech)
- **Pattern**: Anomaly Detection + Classification
- **Problem**: Manual fraud review causing delays and missing sophisticated attacks
- **Solution**: ML model to flag suspicious transactions with human review for high-risk cases
- **Outcome**: Fraud detection rate ↑ 25%; false positive rate ↓ 40%; review time ↓ 70%
- **Lesson**: Start with rule-based baseline; ML improves incrementally; human expertise still critical

### Content Moderation (Social Media)
- **Pattern**: Classification + Content Filtering
- **Problem**: Manual content review unable to scale with user growth
- **Solution**: ML models to flag potentially harmful content for human review
- **Outcome**: Review capacity ↑ 10x; response time ↓ 80%; accuracy maintained at 95%
- **Lesson**: Human-in-the-loop essential for edge cases; regular model retraining critical

### Predictive Maintenance (Manufacturing)
- **Pattern**: Time Series Forecasting + Anomaly Detection
- **Problem**: Unplanned equipment downtime costing $50K+ per hour
- **Solution**: ML models to predict equipment failures and schedule preventive maintenance
- **Outcome**: Unplanned downtime ↓ 35%; maintenance costs ↓ 20%; equipment lifespan ↑ 15%
- **Lesson**: Start with high-value, high-frequency equipment; sensor data quality is foundation

### Customer Churn Prediction (SaaS)
- **Pattern**: Classification + Risk Scoring
- **Problem**: Losing customers without warning, unable to intervene proactively
- **Solution**: ML model to identify customers at risk of churning with intervention recommendations
- **Outcome**: Churn rate ↓ 22%; customer retention ↑ 18%; intervention success rate 65%
- **Lesson**: Early warning better than prediction; actionable insights more valuable than scores

## Implementation Patterns

### High-Impact, Low-Risk Starters
- **Document processing**: High volume, structured outputs, clear success metrics
- **Classification tasks**: Well-defined categories, good training data, measurable accuracy
- **Content summarization**: Repetitive tasks, quality improvements, time savings

### Scaling Considerations
- **Data quality**: Garbage in, garbage out - invest in data preparation
- **Human oversight**: Start with human-in-the-loop, automate incrementally
- **Monitoring**: Track both technical metrics and business outcomes
- **Feedback loops**: Continuous improvement through user feedback and model retraining

### Common Pitfalls
- **Over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
- **Ignoring change management**: Technology is easy, people are hard
- **Missing success metrics**: Define what success looks like before starting
- **Vendor lock-in**: Design for portability from day one
