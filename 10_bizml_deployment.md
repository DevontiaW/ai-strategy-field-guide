# BizML-Inspired Deployment (Textstone Labs)

**What this adds:** a practical, business-first path for getting ML/GenAI **deployed**—not just modeled. It's our adaptation of ideas popularized by "BizML," reframed in Textstone Labs language.

## Why it matters
- Most AI/ML work dies in slides because teams don't plan **for deployment from day 1**.
- When business leaders and data folks don't co-own the plan, great models never make it into operations.
- A clear, staged approach lets you ship faster and with fewer surprises across Legal, Security, and Ops.

## BizML, in Textstone terms
We plan **backwards from launch** and drive the project across six steps:

1) **Value** — Define the business outcome. *What decision, speed, or scale do we improve?*  
2) **Target** — Specify the exact output. *What does the system predict, rank, extract, or generate per case?*  
3) **Performance** — Decide how we'll judge success. *Which metrics, thresholds, and guardrails?*  
4) **Data** — Identify, access, and shape the data. *What sources, quality, permissions, lineage?*  
5) **Model/Pattern** — Train or configure the approach (rules, ML, or GenAI pattern like RAG).  
6) **Launch** — Put it to work in the real workflow; monitor quality, cost, and risk; refresh on a cadence.

> After launch, the work continues: **operate, monitor, and maintain**. Drift, policy changes, and new data mean this is a living system.

## Collaboration & roles (why projects fail or fly)

- **Business side** must own the outcome and speak "semi‑technical" (latency, thresholds, eval basics).
- **Data/ML side** must co-design the workflow, not just the model.
- A named **AI Translator / Product Lead** keeps the two worlds stitched together.
- **Governance partners** (Security, Legal, Risk) are invited early, not at the finish line.

## Step-by-step playbook

### 1) Value — Deployment goal

- Write the "value equation" (cost ↓, revenue ↑, risk ↓, experience ↑, speed ↑).
- Define the decision the system will influence and the owner of that decision.
- Constraints: latency, unit cost, privacy posture, explainability needs.

### 2) Target — Output spec

- Describe the per‑case output (prediction, label, JSON schema, structured extract, or generated text with rubric).
- Note the action the user/system will take based on that output.

### 3) Performance — Evaluation plan

- Select metrics (e.g., precision/recall for classification; faithfulness/groundedness for RAG; rubric for summaries).
- Set thresholds and trade‑offs (e.g., false positive cost vs false negative cost).
- Write the offline + online test plan (golden set, adversarial set, A/B or shadow).

### 4) Data — Fuel

- Source inventory, access approvals, data quality checks, consent/PII handling, retention.
- Feature plan or chunking/embedding plan (for GenAI/RAG).
- Document lineage and data risks.

### 5) Model/Pattern — Algorithm

- Choose the simplest fit (rules → ML → GenAI).
- For GenAI: retrieval design, tool functions, system prompts, temperature/Top‑p; cost/latency budget.
- Keep configs versioned; produce a Model/Prompt Card.

### 6) Launch — Deployment

- Integrate into the real workflow (UI, API, or automation step).
- Add monitoring for quality, cost, latency, and safety; set alert thresholds.
- Define rollback and change‑control.

### Operate — Upkeep

- Schedule refreshes; watch drift; re‑run evals on new data; review incidents.

## Anti‑patterns to avoid

- "Model complete" with no plan for where the output lands.
- Treating deployment as a paperwork step; it's a product release.
- Hand‑offs without a translator; or leaving Legal/Security for last‑minute signoff.
- Assuming more model accuracy will fix a broken workflow.

## Checklist

- [ ] Deployment brief approved (owner, workflow, success metrics, constraints).
- [ ] Output spec + evaluation plan written.
- [ ] Data sources approved; privacy/PII handled; lineage noted.
- [ ] Pattern chosen; cost/latency ceilings set.
- [ ] Monitoring & rollback in place; refresh cadence scheduled.
- [ ] Model/Prompt Card + Post‑deploy review (30/60/90 days).

## Notes on CRISP‑DM vs this approach

CRISP‑DM is a classic general analytics framework; our adaptation focuses more explicitly on prediction/generation outputs and deployment gates. They're compatible; this adds stronger product thinking and operationalization.

## The human lesson

Most "ML failures" aren't algorithmic—they're organizational: no owner, late governance, or no place for the output to live. The paradox: as automation grows, the need for human alignment increases.
