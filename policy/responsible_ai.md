# Responsible AI Policy

## Why This Matters
- **AI systems** can amplify existing biases and create new forms of harm.
- **Responsible deployment** protects users, maintains brand reputation, and ensures compliance.
- **Ethical AI** is not just good practiceâ€”it's increasingly a legal and regulatory requirement.

## Core Principles

### **1. Human-Centered Design**
- **Human oversight**: AI systems augment human capabilities, don't replace human judgment
- **User control**: Users should understand and control how AI affects them
- **Accessibility**: AI systems should be usable by people with diverse abilities

### **2. Fairness & Non-Discrimination**
- **Bias prevention**: Actively identify and mitigate unfair bias in AI systems
- **Equal treatment**: AI systems should not discriminate based on protected characteristics
- **Representative data**: Training data should reflect the diversity of users

### **3. Transparency & Explainability**
- **Clear communication**: Users should understand how AI systems work and make decisions
- **Explainable outputs**: AI decisions should be interpretable by users
- **Audit trails**: Maintain records of AI system behavior and decisions

### **4. Privacy & Security**
- **Data protection**: Respect user privacy and protect personal information
- **Secure systems**: Implement appropriate security controls for AI systems
- **Consent management**: Obtain and maintain appropriate user consent

### **5. Safety & Reliability**
- **Robust performance**: AI systems should work reliably under expected conditions
- **Fail-safe design**: Systems should fail gracefully and safely
- **Continuous monitoring**: Monitor AI systems for unexpected behavior

## Implementation Framework

### **Risk Assessment**

#### **Risk Categories**
1. **High Risk**: AI systems that make decisions affecting human rights, safety, or significant financial outcomes
2. **Medium Risk**: AI systems that influence user behavior or make moderate-impact decisions
3. **Low Risk**: AI systems that provide information or assistance without significant consequences

#### **Risk Factors**
- **Impact scope**: How many people are affected?
- **Decision authority**: What level of autonomy does the AI have?
- **Stakeholder vulnerability**: Are users in positions of power or vulnerability?
- **Reversibility**: Can harmful decisions be easily reversed?

### **Bias Detection & Mitigation**

#### **Bias Types**
- **Data bias**: Training data doesn't represent target population
- **Algorithm bias**: Model learns and amplifies existing biases
- **Interaction bias**: User behavior creates feedback loops
- **Evaluation bias**: Metrics don't capture fairness concerns

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Diverse training data**: Ensure representation across demographic groups
- **Bias testing**: Regular evaluation for unfair discrimination
- **Fairness metrics**: Track performance across different user groups
- **Regular audits**: Periodic review of AI system fairness

### **Transparency Requirements**

#### **User Communication**
- **Clear labeling**: Users should know when they're interacting with AI
- **Purpose explanation**: What the AI system does and why
- **Limitation disclosure**: What the AI system cannot do
- **Contact information**: How to get help or report issues

#### **Technical Transparency**
- **Model documentation**: How the AI system works
- **Data sources**: What data was used to train the system
- **Performance metrics**: How well the system performs
- **Update process**: How and when the system is updated
