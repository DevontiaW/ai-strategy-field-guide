## Evaluation Process

### **Phase 1: Initial Screening**
1. **Request for Information (RFI)**: Basic capabilities and pricing
2. **Vendor shortlist**: 3-5 vendors that meet basic requirements
3. **Initial demos**: Product walkthroughs and use case validation

### **Phase 2: Deep Evaluation**
1. **Technical evaluation**: Proof of concept or pilot
2. **Security review**: Detailed security assessment
3. **Contract negotiation**: Terms, pricing, and SLAs
4. **Reference checks**: Customer validation and feedback

### **Phase 3: Decision & Onboarding**
1. **Vendor selection**: Final decision and contract signing
