# Financials & ROI (CFO-Ready)

## Why it matters
- **CFO approval** is often the gatekeeper for AI investments—clear financial models unlock budgets.
- **ROI transparency** prevents "AI for AI's sake" and ensures business value drives decisions.
- **Cost modeling** reveals hidden expenses (infrastructure, people time, ongoing maintenance) that kill projects.

## Core concepts
- **Net benefit calculation**: Gross savings minus AI run costs minus enablement costs.
- **Payback period**: Implementation cost divided by net monthly benefit.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: How changes in volume, costs, or adoption affect ROI.
- **Total cost of ownership**: Upfront + ongoing costs over 3-5 years.

## Financial model template

### **Monthly Benefit Calculation**
| Item | Assumption | Monthly |
|------|------------|---------:|
| Volume (tasks/month) | 25,000 | - |
| Baseline cost per task | $1.20 | $30,000 |
| Post-AI cost per task | $0.55 | $13,750 |
| **Monthly cost savings** | - | **$16,250** |
| AI run costs (inference, infra, tools) | - | $6,200 |
| Enablement & ops (people time) | - | $2,000 |
| **Net monthly benefit** | - | **$8,050** |

### **Implementation Costs**
| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Development & testing | $45,000 | 3 months × $15k/month |
| Infrastructure setup | $12,000 | Cloud, monitoring, security |
| Change management | $18,000 | Training, comms, rollout |
| **Total implementation** | **$75,000** | |

### **ROI Calculations**
- **Payback period**: $75,000 ÷ $8,050 = **9.3 months**
- **Annual benefit**: $8,050 × 12 = **$96,600**
- **3-year ROI**: ($96,600 × 3) - $75,000 = **$214,800**
- **ROI percentage**: $214,800 ÷ $75,000 = **286%**

## Sensitivity analysis

### **Volume sensitivity (±20%)**
| Volume Change | Monthly Benefit | Payback Period |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| -20% | $6,440 | 11.6 months |
| Baseline | $8,050 | 9.3 months |
| +20% | $9,660 | 7.8 months |

### **Cost sensitivity (±15%)**
| Cost Change | Monthly Benefit | Payback Period |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| -15% | $9,258 | 8.1 months |
| Baseline | $8,050 | 9.3 months |
| +15% | $6,843 | 11.0 months |

### **Adoption sensitivity (±10%)**
| Adoption Change | Monthly Benefit | Payback Period |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| -10% | $7,245 | 10.4 months |
| Baseline | $8,050 | 9.3 months |
| +10% | $8,855 | 8.5 months |

## Playbook (step-by-step)

### 1. **Baseline measurement**
- Document current process costs (people, tools, time)
- Measure volume and variability
- Identify quality metrics and error costs

### 2. **AI solution costing**
- Model inference costs per task
- Infrastructure and tool licensing
- Ongoing maintenance and support

### 3. **Enablement costs**
- Training and change management
- Process redesign and integration
- Ongoing operational overhead

### 4. **Benefit calculation**
- Direct cost savings (people, tools)
- Quality improvements (error reduction)
- Speed and scale benefits
- Risk mitigation value

### 5. **Sensitivity modeling**
- Test key assumptions
- Model worst-case scenarios
- Build confidence intervals

### 6. **Approval package**
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Detailed cost breakdown
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Implementation timeline and milestones

## Anti-patterns

- **"AI will pay for itself"** without cost modeling
- **Ignoring people costs** (training, change management, ongoing ops)
- **No sensitivity analysis** on key assumptions
- **Underestimating infrastructure** and maintenance costs
- **Missing opportunity costs** of delayed implementation

## Checklist

- [ ] Current process costs documented and measured
- [ ] AI solution costs modeled (inference, infra, tools)
- [ ] Enablement costs included (training, change management)
- [ ] Benefits quantified (cost savings, quality, speed, scale)
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis completed on key variables
- [ ] Payback period calculated and reasonable (<18 months)
- [ ] Implementation costs broken down by phase
- [ ] Risk factors identified and mitigation planned

## Metrics / Proof of value

### **Leading indicators**
- Cost per task trending down
- Volume handled per FTE increasing
- Quality metrics improving
- Adoption rates meeting targets

### **Lagging indicators**

- Total ROI over time
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores

### **Financial health checks**
- Monthly benefit vs. run costs
- Infrastructure cost per task
- Enablement cost amortization
- Break-even analysis updates
