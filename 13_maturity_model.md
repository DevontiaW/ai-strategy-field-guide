# AI Maturity Model (Organizational Roadmap)

## Why it matters
- **Clear progression path** helps leaders understand where they are and what "good" looks like.
- **Resource planning** becomes easier with defined maturity levels and requirements.
- **Stakeholder alignment** on realistic timelines and investment needs.

## Core concepts
- **Maturity levels**: Ad-hoc → Piloting → Operational → Scaled
- **Dimensions**: People, Process, Technology, Governance
- **Progression gates**: Clear criteria for advancing to next level
- **Investment curve**: Resources needed increase with maturity

## Maturity assessment grid

| Dimension | L1 Ad‑hoc | L2 Piloting | L3 Operational | L4 Scaled |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **People** | No owner | Project owner | Product + AI Translator | PMO + community of practice |
| **Process** | One‑off experiments | Pilot gates | Standard stage gates | Portfolio mgmt & reuse |
| **Tech** | SaaS tools only | Mixed tools + first RAG | Platform with logging & eval | Multi‑tenant, cost controls |
| **Governance** | Case‑by‑case | Draft policies | Policy + audits | Continuous risk mgmt & training |

- [ ] **Timeline**: 3-6 month pilot plan

### **L2 → L3: Going Operational**
- [ ] **Pilot success**: Demonstrated value and feasibility
- [ ] **Process**: Standardized gates and procedures
- [ ] **Technology**: Platform and infrastructure ready
- [ ] **Governance**: Policies and risk framework in place
- [ ] **Resources**: Budget and team for production

### **L3 → L4: Scaling Excellence**
- [ ] **Portfolio**: Multiple successful AI systems
- [ ] **Efficiency**: Optimized processes and reuse
- [ ] **Innovation**: Continuous improvement culture

## Investment requirements

### **People costs**
- **L1**: 0.1-0.5 FTE (champion time)
- **L2**: 0.5-2 FTE (project owner + support)
- **L3**: 2-8 FTE (dedicated team)
- **L4**: 8+ FTE (specialized roles)

### **Technology costs**
- **L1**: $10K-50K (SaaS tools)
- **L2**: $50K-200K (mixed approach)
- **L3**: $200K-1M (platform + infrastructure)
- **L4**: $1M+ (enterprise platform)

### **Process costs**
- **L1**: Minimal (ad-hoc)
- **L2**: $20K-50K (pilot processes)

## Anti-patterns

- **Skipping levels**: Trying to jump from L1 to L3 without building foundation
- **Over-investing early**: Building enterprise platform before proving value
- **Ignoring people**: Focusing only on technology without process and governance
- **No progression plan**: Staying at same level without clear advancement path
